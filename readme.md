# Static menus for WordPress | inventivo

This plugin saves every WordPress menu as a static HTML file in the folder /static in your server root directory. Whenever you save a menu the HTML files a recreated.
Including the menus as static files saves time for rendering the menus which results in faster page loading times.

**This is an example for including the files in your WordPress Theme:**

```<?php require_once ( $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/static/primary.html" ); ?>```

The filename is created from menu location + .html

This plugin is tested with WordPress native menus and Max Megamenu Plugin.

**Small and simple:**
* Responsive - fits to all screens
* Easy configuration
* Lighweight code
